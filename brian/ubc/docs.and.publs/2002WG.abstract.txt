This paper presents a novel variation of wave pipelining that
we call ``surfing.''  In previous wave pipelined designs,
timing uncertainty grows monotonically as events propagate
through gates or other logic elements.  We bound this
dispersion by propagating a timing pulse along with the data
values.  Our logic elements have delays that are smaller in
the presence of the pulse than in its absence.  This produces
a ``surfing'' effect:  events are bound in close proximity to
the timing pulse.  We demonstrate this approach with the
design of a 4x12 multiplier.  Spice simulations from the
extracted layout indicate that this design is robust in the
presence of fabrication parameter variation and power supply
noise.  Because timing is maintained by accelerating the
logic, our designs achieve lower latency than their purely
combinational equivalents.  Thus, the control overhead for
these designs is indeed negative.
