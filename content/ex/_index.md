This is a collection of things from my past. Ex-things, if you will.

## 1992 to 1997

From 1992 to 1997, I studied at and eventually graduated with a B.S. in [Engineering and Applied Science](https://www.eas.caltech.edu/) from [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu/). Within E&AS, I focused on Computer Science. I found asynchronous VLSI design to be particularly interesting. I did the 4-1/3 year plan in 5 years. I think I might have performed better and certainly would have enjoyed my time more had I gone into the experience planning to take 5 years. I really would have benefitted from a better sleep schedule and regular medicinal doses of amphetamine salts. Unfortunately I was, respectively, a dumbass who didn't take care of himself and suffered from the relatively primitive medical understanding of ADHD[^adhd] in the 1980s.

[^adhd]: In the 1980s, ADHD diagnosis and treatment was all about controlling severely disruptive children. I like to refer to that as ad**H**D, with a strong emphasis on the hyperactive. Those of us with nondisruptive ADD (ADhD), where we our primary symptom is being generally either uninterested or hyperfocused, were not well understood or a focus of treatment during that era.

## 1998 to 2003

I lived in Vancouver, BC, from 1998 to 2003, often studying [Computer Science](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/) at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/). I earned my M.Sc. with [Alan Hu](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/people/alan-hu) and failed[^phd] to earn a Ph.D. with [Mark Greenstreet](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/people/mark-greenstreet). I also was often playing [disc](https://vancitydiscgolf.ca/jericho) [sports](https://www.vul.ca/), playing amatuer sysadmin, or just hanging out at [Koerner's](https://www.koerners.ca). When I was focused I was a very good programmer (mostly C++ and C, but also pretty solid on Python 2) and could draw a passible circuit in [magic](http://opencircuitdesign.com/magic/). I found other things to stimulate my brain when possible, e.g., working with the wonderful [Anne Condon](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/people/anne-condon) on recruitment and retention of women and serving on the faculty hiring committee. Living north of 49Â° lattitude was not good for my mental health overall. Despite being a depressive introvert, I made some amazing friends. I was a mediocre poker player and horrible at mahjong. Many of these skills and behavio(u)rs were consistent with contemporary depression and much later ADHD diagnoses. I greatly enjoyed my time in Vancouver. I also should have left sooner.

[^phd]: The fault for failing to earn a Ph.D. is entirely my own and is in no way a reflection on Mark as my supervisor. It turns out that you can do extremely well in high school, earn a B.S., and earn a M.S(c). almost entirely on talent. A Ph.D. is an entirely different beast, and depends at least as much on discipline as it does on intellectual ability. In retrospect, I was poorly suited to be an academic. Becoming a Ph.Dropout was the best possible outcome.

I had a CV-ish web page summarizing my [academic studies](ubc/).
